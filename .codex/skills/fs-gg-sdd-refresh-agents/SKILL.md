description: The FS.GG SDD cross-cutting generators — fsgg-sdd refresh (regenerate the work model, agent guidance, and summary.md to currency) and fsgg-sdd agents (derive per-target Claude/Codex command + skill guidance from the work model). Not lifecycle stages. Use whenever authored sources change.
---

# Generators: `refresh` and `agents`

These two commands are **not** lifecycle stages — they bring generated views back
to currency and emit no next-stage action. Run them whenever authored sources
change, because in SDD **presence is not currency**: a generated view on disk that
has not been re-derived from its current sources is stale.

## `fsgg-sdd refresh --work <id>`

Regenerates the SDD-owned generated views to currency:

- rebuilds `readiness/<id>/work-model.json`,
- regenerates the per-target agent guidance,
- renders the human-readable `readiness/<id>/summary.md`,
- reports the currency of `analysis.json` / `verify.json` / `ship.json`.

It is the only command that runs under an overwrite policy that allows refreshing
generated views.

```text
fsgg-sdd refresh --work <id>
```

## `fsgg-sdd agents --work <id>`

Derives per-target Claude/Codex command and skill guidance **from**
`readiness/<id>/work-model.json` into `readiness/<id>/agent-commands/<target>/`:

- `guidance.json` — the manifest (sources, digests, generator identity),
- `commands.md` — the per-work command guidance,
- `skills.md` — the per-work skill obligations projection.

```text
fsgg-sdd agents --work <id>
```

## Why generated guidance is not authority

The files under `agent-commands/<target>/` are a **projection of the work model**,
marked generated with source digests. They are governed by `.fsgg/agents.yml`:

```yaml
policy:
  generatedGuidanceIsAuthority: false
  requireEquivalentClaudeAndCodexBehavior: true
```

- `generatedGuidanceIsAuthority: false` — the generated `commands.md`/`skills.md`
  are never a second source of truth; the authored sources + work model are the
  contract.
- `requireEquivalentClaudeAndCodexBehavior: true` — Claude and Codex guidance must
  describe aligned behavior; divergence is a diagnostic.

## Two windows

- **Before the work model exists** (`charter`/`specify`/`clarify`/`checklist`):
  `agents`/`refresh` cannot derive per-work guidance, so they emit a **non-blocking
  advisory** (exit 0) pointing at `.fsgg/early-stage-guidance.md`. Only the
  *missing* work-model case is reclassified this way; malformed/stale/blocked still
  block.
- **After `verify`/`ship` build the work model:** the `agent-commands/<target>/`
  views become the live per-work guidance.

## Currency model

Every generated view records its `sources` (each with a sha256 `digest` and
`schemaVersion`), an `outputDigest`, the `generator` id + version, and a
`currency` (`current · missing · stale · malformed · blocked`). The
`sdd.yml` `generatedViews.staleBehavior: diagnostic` setting means a digest
mismatch emits a stale diagnostic rather than hard-failing.

## Pitfalls

- Editing an authored source and trusting the old generated view — re-run
  `refresh`. The view is stale until re-derived.
- Treating `agent-commands/<target>/skills.md` as authoritative — it is a
  generated projection, not a source of truth.
