# Governance design

This folder is the current, comprehensive design for the FS.GG governance
system. It supersedes the monolithic "SpecFlow graph operating system" idea and
re-founds governance as a **small, reusable agent-governance kernel** with
domain-specific adapters — not a platform every project must run on.

The aim is broader than F# software. The same kernel should govern essays,
research, and engineering work as cleanly as it governs a rendering framework.
What changes between domains is the *fact vocabulary*; the inference, the
arbitration model, the evidence model, and the rule language stay the same.

## One sentence

Governance is a **pure inference kernel** over typed facts and rules, where every
rule declares *who is competent to decide it* (machine, agent, or human), every
rule's check is **reified data** that can be evaluated, rendered, hashed, and
explained from one source, and the enforcement layer is **light and advisory by
default** with a loud, local-only escape hatch for everyday work.

## Design documents

Read in order:

- [The theory of the rule engine — a textbook](rule-engine-theory.md) — a
  self-contained teaching narrative tying the whole design together: the logic and
  algebra, reduction to a fixed point (with diagrams), the failure modes and their
  mitigations, four worked adapter examples, the planning/optimization boundary, and
  the pros and cons of governing an agent. Start here for the connected story; the
  documents below are the per-topic reference.
- [Goals and principles](principles.md) — what the system is, the pivot away from
  the monolith, kernel-as-product, and the four principles the design is built
  to guarantee (light by default, advisory by default, explainable by
  construction, honest escape hatch).
- [The inference kernel](kernel.md) — the domain-neutral core: facts, rules,
  fixed-point evaluation, provenance, the `CheckTier` arbitration model, and the
  evidence / synthetic-taint model.
- [The rule eDSL](rule-edsl.md) — the reified `Check` algebra in plain F#, its
  combinators, the four interpreters (`eval` / `render` / `hash` / `explain`),
  the `Opaque` escape hatch, and the bridge back to the kernel.
- [Routing, severity, and run modes](routing-and-modes.md) — light-by-default
  routing, the `Severity` axis, the `RunMode` escape hatch, the unbypassable
  merge boundary, and the explainable `Route` output.
- [Domain adapters](adapters.md) — how a domain plugs in: the design-system
  adapter and its rule catalog, plus research, essay, and engineering sketches
  that demonstrate generality.
- [Spec-driven development in the system](speckit-in-the-system.md) — how the
  GitHub Spec Kit workflow shape is realized as native FS.GG lifecycle commands,
  artifacts, rules, evidence, and ship gates.
- [Theory and composition](theory-and-composition.md) — the footing: Data Types à
  la Carte, applicative inspectability, the phase-machine-emits-facts layering,
  explicit deterministic cross-domain combinators, and the policy-engine prior art
  (Cedar, OPA/Rego), with citations.
- [Scope: planning, optimization, and what the kernel is for](planning-and-optimization.md)
  — why the kernel is a monotonic deductive *checker* (Cedar's paradigm,
  generalized in domain), why planning and optimization are deliberately not
  native, and how the design still governs a planner or optimizer by checking its
  outputs at the edge.
- [Test design: governance adapters for Sojourn](testdesign-sojourn.md) — a worked
  second-adopter test on a deterministic Rust 4X game: multiple gameplay-invariant
  and software-development adapters that reify the project's existing ad-hoc rules.
- [Adapter proposal: Sojourn's research system](adapter-sojourn-research.md) — a
  deep dive on the single richest invariant surface in the game (Understanding
  Levels + TRL maturation, seeding, breakthroughs, the science tide, reliability):
  complex reified rules (graph folds, property laws, determinism ordering, seed-sweep
  bands) and what the adapter buys over scattered Rust tests and implicit clamps.
- [Lessons and anti-goals](lessons.md) — why the previous attempt became opaque
  and oppressive, the anti-goals that prevent a repeat, and how this design
  honours the project-split decision.
- [Open questions](open-questions.md) — gaps and risks surfaced by the
  [2026-06-18 research review](../reports/2026-06-18-governance-design-research.md)
  (offline synthesis + adversarial online verification of the prior-art and theory
  claims), tracked as GitHub issues.

## Status

Design only. The inference kernel, the reified eDSL, severity/run-mode routing,
and the adapters described here are envisioned, not yet implemented. The
prior-art enforcement machinery (routing, gates, evidence audit) exists in the
FS-Skia-UI repository and is the starting point this design refactors.
