# /speckit.constitution

Populate `.specify/memory/constitution.md` from the preset's
`constitution-template.md`. The template contains three kinds of sections,
marked by HTML comments:

- `<!-- REQUIRED -->` — placeholders MUST be filled. Ask the user for each.
- `<!-- TAILORABLE -->` — tune per project. Ask the user what's appropriate
  for this project's domain and stack. You MAY add or reword bullets within
  these sections.
- `<!-- LOCKED -->` — do NOT modify these sections. The six Core Principles,
  Change Classification, Local Skills, Development Workflow, and Governance
  sections are shared doctrine across every project using this preset. If the user
  explicitly asks to modify a locked section, pause and confirm: *"This
  section is marked LOCKED because it's shared across every project using
  the fsharp-opinionated preset. Are you sure you want a per-project
  amendment, or should this become an upstream preset change?"*

## Placeholders to fill

The REQUIRED section uses these placeholders. Ask for each:

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` — the project's display name (often matches the repo name).
- `[CONSTITUTION_VERSION]` — start at `1.0.0` for a new project.
- `[RATIFICATION_DATE]` — today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `[LAST_AMENDED_DATE]` — same as ratification on first write.

The TAILORABLE section uses these placeholders. Offer reasonable defaults
and let the user accept or override:

- `[PACK_OUTPUT_PATH]` — default `~/.local/share/nuget-local/`.
- `[LOGGING_LIBRARY]` — default "not yet selected; see ADR when chosen."
  Common F# choices: Serilog, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, Logary.
- `[PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS]` — any project-specific rules (runtime target,
  deployment target, supported OS). If none, write "None beyond the
  defaults above."

## Output

- Write the filled constitution to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- Remove the HTML comment markers from the final output (they're authoring
  aids, not reader content).
- Do NOT remove the LOCKED-section text itself. Only the `<!-- LOCKED -->`
  marker lines go.
- Produce a short summary for the user naming (a) what placeholders were
  filled, (b) what TAILORABLE choices were made, and (c) confirming no
  LOCKED sections were modified.

## If the constitution file already exists

Do not overwrite silently. Diff the existing file against the current
template and offer three options:

1. Update only REQUIRED/TAILORABLE placeholders in place (preserve any
   existing tailoring).
2. Refresh from the current template, preserving the existing project's
   TAILORABLE choices (warn if LOCKED sections have diverged — that's a
   sign the preset was amended upstream).
3. Abort and let the user edit manually.
